## Step 1:

### Download and Install Git

* Git Bash Download : [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

* Git Desktop Download: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Step 2:

### Clone the Repository
Now you need a copy locally, so find the “SSH clone URL” in the right hand column and use that to clone locally using a terminal:
> git clone https://github.com/FOSS-UCSC/demo
 

## Step 3:

### Do some work

Example: Write your name on a text file and save it as yourname.txt

## Step 4:

### Create a new Branch with your name

> git checkout -b yourname
 
## Step 5:

### Push your work to github

> git add .

> git commit -am "I wrote my name"

> git push origin yourname
